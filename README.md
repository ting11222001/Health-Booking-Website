# Thriveful - Mental Health Booking Website

Welcome to the Thriveful Mental Health Website repository! 

This project is a comprehensive application constructed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It serves as a prototype website dedicated to advancing mental health and well-being, offering affordable online counseling sessions and curated articles from experts, fostering the development of a supportive peer community among users. Future plans for this project include the integration of a discussion forum, events page, and an admin dashboard page

## Technologies

- Vite
- React
- MongoDB
- Stripe

## Features

### Frontend

- Implemented loading animations and toast notifications to provide users with a seamless interface experience during data submission from frontend to backend.
- Ensured responsive design across all devices for optimal user experience.

### Backend

- Established protected routes to enforce restricted operations on specific API routes; for instance, only "patients" are permitted to create reviews for doctors.
- Implemented bcryptjs for cryptographic hashing to fortify the security of users' passwords during registration, guaranteeing that only hashed strings are stored in the database.
- Implemented user authentication using JWT tokens, enabling persistent user sessions even after closing the browser window, and granting access to designated features such as individual user profile pages.
- Implemented a mechanism for dropping databases and seeding data to facilitate easy testing processes.


## Test User Login Information
To test the credential authentication functionality, you can use the following admin and user (patients/doctors) login information:

admin:
```bash
{
    "email": "admin@gmail.com",
    "password": "1234"
}
```

users (i.e. patient):
```bash
{
    "email": "mila@gmail.com",
    "password": "123"
}

{
    "email": "emma@gmail.com",
    "password": "123"
}
```

doctors:
```bash
{
    "email": "anna@gmail.com",
    "password": "1234"
}

{
    "email": "john@gmail.com",
    "password": "1234"
}
```

## Stripe test card's information:
